"""
trade_live.py removed: this repository's scripts use Hyperliquid public Info API
and perform offline simulations only. No API keys or live-order scaffolding
are present in this version.

If you later want live-order scaffolding, ask and I will add it in a separate
file and keep it disabled by default.
